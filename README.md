## Photobooth

**ðŸš¨ Not my finest work - this is a really crappy little app I've built on a plane. For NYE!**

### Get it going

- Clone the repo
- `npm start`
- Head to [http://localhost:3000/photos](localhost:3000/photos)
And you should see four boxes

### Okay great, now what?
The rest of it is on the Raspberry Pi. And there'll be some sort of Websockets thing.

### What's the point?
Wanted to recreate Photobot photoboothes:
